### Recap of Students Goals

<!--
- what tasks are you aiming to have completed by the end of the week
-->

- image handling!
- backend unit testing for image upload
- front end refactor to handle images in mobile
- display posting text fields in front end
- display post images in front end

## Roadblocks

It turns out not to be trivial to deal with images in a mobile app.

- react native needs image paths to be static -> ready at compile time
- this makes is hard to post images, create new paths, and display
- the solution seems to be using uri, I have yet to be successful using uri
- I have been able to hard code paths to images in to ensure it can be displayed but this too is problematic -> currently experiencing the hard coded images displaying randomly (or the reason is not yet obvious to me)

- [x] image handling!
- [x] front end refactor to handle images in mobile
- [x] display post images in front end
- [x] create review model
- [x] link reviews to users by giver and receiver
- [x] create API endpoints for Review CRUD
- [x] test the API in isolation (POSTMAN) / DRF gui
- [x] unit testing for Review
- [x] add function to auto update user rating when new review is received
- [x] permissions refactor to allow access of user data -> populates fields such as rating, name, etc on posts.

### Gauged effort

- I felt like I went beyond the average weekly contribution this week. Handling the images, creating a global state management, and dynamically re-rendering the app was non-trivial for me. It was also front-end work I was unfamiliar with.
- After finishing off the images tasks, I was able to complete an additional feature of Reviews, with a auto-updating rating for the user.

### Gauged effort

- This week's effort and implementation was on par with expectations. I was able to implement a new feature, profile picture handling in the backend, supported by test cases, and implemented an API call to update the user's info with profile picture data. This is now ready for plug and chug when the front-end is set up.

- [x] integrate profile picture logic into front end
- [x] allow posts to be filtered by id (backend)
- [x] integrate post filtering in front end (Alex did most of the work, just wrapping up loose ends)
- [x] refactor global state to listen for profile picture update and re-render on change
- [x] unit testing

### Gauged effort

- This week's effort and implementation was on par with expectations. I was able to implement a 2 new features, profile picture handling in the font end (big portion was Alex, I just connected some API calls and other logic to update), and filter posts by owner ID, supported by test cases. Minimal code contributions for adding filtering, but necessary for app functionality. Getting profile picture to re-render when changed went smooth as I followed the same logic for adding images to posts.

### Gauged effort

- This week's effort and implementation was on par with expectations. I was able to test 2 new features, editing and deleting posts server side. Refactored permissions to ensure only users can edit delete their own posts, and admin has priveleges on all posts. Wrote the front end code for the API endpoints, now need to integrate the API calls into UI.

### Gauged effort

- This week's effort and implementation was on par with expectations. I was able to add a front end feature - expiry tags. Added automation for getting IP address and launching our severs with one command. I set up the CI pipeline to run our backend tests for all PRs into develop and master branches (and ci). I attempted to deploy the backend with pythonanywhere but quickly surpassed the free tier of compute credit - unsuccessful. Will look into this later.
